# Riemann Zeta Function and Prime Number Theorem — Lean 4 Formalization

A Lean 4 project developing formalized infrastructure around the Riemann zeta
function, Hardy's theorem, zero-free regions, and Prime Number Theorem statements.
It is built on Mathlib and currently serves as a buildable proof framework with
explicitly isolated unproved target statements.

The publishable core of the current repository is:

> **de la Vallee Poussin 3-4-1 machinery and a compact zero-free strip in Lean 4**

This means the project verifies the local analytic mechanism

1. the real-part Dirichlet-series expansion for `-ζ'/ζ` in terms of the von
   Mangoldt function;
2. the 3-4-1 logarithmic-derivative inequality using
   `3 + 4*cos θ + cos (2*θ) >= 0`;
3. the compactness argument turning Mathlib's nonvanishing on `Re(s) >= 1` into
   a positive-width zero-free strip for each fixed height bound.

The repository does **not** claim the classical quantitative zero-free region
`σ >= 1 - c / log |t|`, the full PNT, or RH.

## Paper Positioning

The recommended paper framing is to make the `3-4-1 + compact zero-free strip`
module the main contribution, with the remaining infrastructure presented as
secondary contributions and future work.  This keeps the claims tight:

1. **Primary contribution:** formalizing the real-part logarithmic-derivative
   Dirichlet series, the de la Vallee Poussin 3-4-1 inequality, and the compact
   zero-free strip.
2. **Secondary contribution:** correctly formulating the Riemann-von Mangoldt
   explicit formula target using `chebyshevPsi0`, finite-height truncations, and
   explicit error/remainder forms rather than an unordered infinite zero sum.
3. **Supporting contribution:** proving PNT-form equivalences and RH-scale error
   propagation lemmas that will compose with a future proof of `ψ(x) ~ x` or a
   future explicit formula theorem.
4. **Framework contribution:** building a Hardy-Z/critical-line-zero framework
   with explicit target statements for Hardy, Hardy-Littlewood, Selberg, and
   Conrey-style zero-counting results.
5. **Mathlib roadmap:** isolating the missing analytic inputs: zeta growth and
   logarithmic-derivative estimates for quantitative zero-free regions, Perron
   and residue-theorem machinery for the explicit formula, and special-function
   asymptotics for Hardy's theorem.

The strongest current title direction is:

> **Formalizing the 3-4-1 Inequality and a Compact Zero-Free Strip for the
> Riemann Zeta Function in Lean 4**

Broader PNT/RH/Hardy titles should be used only if the title clearly says this
is infrastructure or a framework, not a completed proof of PNT or RH.

## Status

`lake build` succeeds with Lean 4.29.1 / Mathlib 4.29.1. The repository is not
a completed proof of the Prime Number Theorem or the Riemann Hypothesis.

Current code status:

| File | `sorry` count | Unproved targets |
|---|---:|---|
| `GammaResidue.lean` | 0 | General Gamma residue formula completed |
| `HardyTheorem.lean` | 0 | Hardy-Z phase facts proved; corrected integral asymptotic, positivity and zero-counting targets |
| `PrimeNumberTheorem.lean` | 0 | Bounded-height zero finiteness proved; RH error equivalence and von Mangoldt explicit formula targets |
| `ZeroFreeRegion.lean` | 0 | 3-4-1 and compact zero-free region proved; quantitative zero-free-region targets |

Total: 0 syntactic `sorry` occurrences in Lean source files.

Unresolved mathematical target declarations (currently not promoted to
theorems): **22**.

 - `HardyTheorem` namespace: 7
 - `HardyTheorem.Details` namespace: 3
 - `PrimeNumberTheorem` namespace: 9
 - `KnownResults` namespace: 1
 - `ZeroFreeRegion` namespace: 1
 - global namespace: 1 (`vinogradov_korobov_zero_free_region`)

Full `def ... : Prop` inventory:

- mathematical targets: 22;
- route interfaces: 4
  (`HardyTheorem.AFE.zeta_critical_afe_target`,
  `MathlibAux.rectangleIntegral_meromorphic_eq_residue_sum`,
  `PrimeNumberTheorem.ExplicitFormulaTruncated.ExplicitFormulaTruncatedTarget`,
  `RiemannExplorer.Conrey40.conrey_40_percent_zeros_on_critical_line_target`);
- reusable predicates: 2
  (`HardyTheorem.weightedIntegralOf_tail_dominates`,
  `PrimeNumberTheorem.ExplicitFormulaAux.goodHeight`);
- unclassified Prop definitions: 0.

The only remaining route interface whose body is still `True` is
`MathlibAux.rectangleIntegral_meromorphic_eq_residue_sum`; it is kept as an
explicit contour/residue-theorem interface, not as a proved theorem.

## Verified Components

The project currently verifies several supporting statements, including:

- the formal RH statement restricted to nontrivial zeros;
- zeta special-value and Euler-product wrappers available in Mathlib;
- basic PNT-form equivalence scaffolding and asymptotic lemmas;
- the trigonometric identity `3 + 4cos θ + cos 2θ = 2(1+cos θ)² ≥ 0`;
- the full 3-4-1 logarithmic-derivative nonnegativity combination;
- several zeta nonvanishing and pole-behavior wrappers from Mathlib;
- the Gamma residue formula at negative integers and numerical special cases;
- the compact zero-free region near `Re(s)=1` for each bounded height;
- finiteness of nontrivial zeros in each bounded-height strip.

## Publication Core and Remaining Targets

### 3-4-1 Logarithmic-Derivative Combination

```
3·Re(-ζ'/ζ(σ)) + 4·Re(-ζ'/ζ(σ+it)) + Re(-ζ'/ζ(σ+2it)) ≥ 0
```

The full infinite-series combination is proved in
`ZeroFreeRegion.log_deriv_zeta_nonneg_combination`.

### Compact Zero-Free Region

For any T ≥ 2, there exists d > 0 such that ζ(s) has no zeros in
{|Im(s)| ≤ T, Re(s) ≥ 1-d}.

This is proved in `ZeroFreeRegion.classical_zero_free_region_compact`.

### Prime Number Theorem Equivalences

The three classical forms are equivalent:
1. π(x) ~ x/log x
2. π(x) ~ Li(x)
3. ψ(x) ~ x

These equivalence and error-propagation lemmas are supporting infrastructure.
They are useful for composition once an analytic PNT input is available, but the
three PNT forms themselves remain `def ... : Prop` target statements in this
repository.

### Von Mangoldt Explicit Formula

The current repository contains this as a corrected `Prop` target statement,
not as a proved theorem.  The Lean target now uses the midpoint convention
`chebyshevPsi0` and a height-truncated zero contribution
`finiteNontrivialZeroSum`, rather than an unconditional unordered `tsum` over
all nontrivial zeros.

### Target Statements, Not Proved Theorems

The remaining 22 target declarations are intentionally `def ... : Prop` rather
than theorem declarations. They are tracked as future proof obligations and must
not be cited as completed proofs:

- PNT and RH-scale error targets:
  `PNTForm1`, `PNTForm2`, `PNTForm3`, `RH_PsiErrorBound`,
  `RH_ThetaErrorBound`, `RH_PrimeCountingLiErrorBound`, `RH_ErrorBound`,
  `rh_iff_optimal_error`;
- explicit formula target:
  `explicit_formula_von_mangoldt`;
- quantitative zero-free-region targets:
  `classical_zero_free_region`, `vinogradov_korobov_zero_free_region`;
- Hardy/critical-line targets:
  `integral_asymptotic_target`, `hardy_two_signed_moments_target`,
  `hardy_theorem_target`, `hardy_zeros_unbounded_target`,
  `hardy_zeros_abs_unbounded_target`, `hardy_littlewood_lower_bound_target`,
  `selberg_zero_proportion_target`,
  `HardyTheorem.Details.gamma_asymptotic_half_plus_it_target`,
  `HardyTheorem.Details.theta_asymptotic_target`,
  `HardyTheorem.Details.approximate_functional_equation_target`,
  `KnownResults.conrey_40_percent_zeros_on_critical_line_target`.

The four missing analytic chains are:

1. **Quantitative zero-free region**: upgrade the compact strip to
   `1 - c / log |t|` using zeta growth and logarithmic-derivative estimates
   together with Borel-Caratheodory or Hadamard/Jensen machinery.
2. **Explicit formula**: prove the Perron/residue-theorem chain that yields the
   finite-height Riemann-von Mangoldt formula for `chebyshevPsi0`.
3. **RH error equivalence**: connect the explicit formula under RH to the
   `sqrt x * log x` prime-counting error and prove the reverse implication.
4. **Hardy theorem**: prove the signed moment/asymptotic inputs for Hardy's
   theorem and the stronger critical-line zero-counting targets.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) via `elan`
- [Elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) (Lean version manager)
- The checked-in `lean-toolchain` pins Lean to `leanprover/lean4:v4.29.1`

### Build

```bash
# Install Lean 4 via elan (if not already installed)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/cc-chen-tech/riemann-pnt-lean4.git
cd riemann-pnt-lean4
lake build
```

This checkout is configured to use a local path dependency at `vendor/mathlib`.
That directory is ignored by git because it is large. For a fresh clone, either
place Mathlib 4.29.1 at `vendor/mathlib`, or change `lakefile.lean` back to a
git dependency and regenerate the manifest.

## Infrastructure Gaps

See [`PUBLISHING.md`](PUBLISHING.md) for the exact release-readiness checklist
and the commands used to verify the current proof-gap count.

See [`docs/mathematical-contributions.md`](docs/mathematical-contributions.md)
for a precise mathematical description of the project-local verified
contributions and their proof routes.

See [`docs/formal-theorem-inventory.md`](docs/formal-theorem-inventory.md)
for a reviewer-oriented inventory separating proved declarations from target
statements.

See [`docs/target-statements-and-chains.md`](docs/target-statements-and-chains.md)
for a compact checklist of all `def ... : Prop` targets and the four missing
analytic chains they belong to.

See [`docs/implementation-standards.md`](docs/implementation-standards.md)
for the standard that prevents target statements from being reported as proved
theorems.

See [`docs/missing-chains-index.md`](docs/missing-chains-index.md) for the
parallel work breakdown of the remaining analytic chains.

| Theorem | Missing Mathlib Component | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| Explicit formula (Perron) | Contour integration / Residue theorem | High |
| Classical zero-free region (σ ≥ 1-c/log|t|) | Hadamard factorization or Borel-Carathéodory | Medium |
| Vinogradov-Korobov zero-free region | Exponential sum estimates | Very High |
| Hardy's theorem targets | Corrected moment estimates and asymptotic expansions of special functions | Medium–High |

### Easiest Path Forward

The **Borel-Carathéodory** route is lighter than full Hadamard factorization,
but this repository still needs additional zeta growth and logarithmic-derivative
estimates before the quantitative zero-free region can be closed.
